## Instructions
- **Each question is 2 points.**
- **Type your name in the Author section above**
- **Write the `codes` for all questions in this R Notebook (file).**
- **ALWAYS comment your code.**

- Read in the saccharomyces_cerevisiae.fasta and saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff to answer the questions 

1. Using the genome annotation file, create a histogram of gene lengths of all `tRNA_gene`. (2 pt)
2. Create a DNAStringSet of all `tRNA_gene` sequences of length 72 bp. Be aware of strand orientation. (2 pt)
3. Use the code from Lab-16 to create a DNAStringSet of intron-less CDS in yeast. Create forward and reverse primers that are 30bp long for each CDS in the yeast genome. (3 pts)
4. Arginine is basic residues. How many genes have stretches of 5 arginines, and which gene has the most? (3 pt)
