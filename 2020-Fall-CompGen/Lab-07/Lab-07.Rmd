## Loops
- `for` loops with indices

## Exercise 6.3
1. Count the number of 4s in sample of 1000 unbiased die rolls using `for` loops.
2. Using `for` loops, count the number of NAs in `new_tests`.

## Exercise 7.1
1. Write a `for` loop to estimate the 5-day running average of `new_tests` for `United States`.

## Nested loops

## Indefinite loops
- `while` loop

## Exercise 7.2
1. Keep rolling an unbiased dice until you see a 1. How many dice rolls did it take?
2. You have a biased dice where even numbers are 3 times as likely as odd numbers. Keep rolling it until you see a 1. How many dice or you have rolled the dice 10 times, whichever comes first.

## Functions

## Exercise 7.3
1. Write a function to calculate factorial of a value.
2. Write a function to calculate the fibonacci series up to n elements.
