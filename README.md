## Computational Genomics

This course will serve as the broad umbrella under which materials for the following two cross-listed courses will be shared.
1) Computational Genomics 16:761:505
2) Computational Genetics of Big Data 01:447:303 (apologies for the terrible name)

The main focus of this course is to learn R programming and apply it towards analysis of genomic datasets. In this course, we will focus on basics of programming, data wrangling, creating user-defined functions, and exploratory graphical data analysis. The primary data sets considered will contain genome sequences, genome annotations, RNA-seq and/or other expression data from multiple model organisms.
