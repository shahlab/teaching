## Loops
- `for` loops with indices
- factorial example

## Exercise 7.1
1. Count the number of 4s in sample of 1000 unbiased die rolls using `for` loops.
2. Using `for` loops, count the number of NAs in `daily_vaccinations`.

## Nested loops

## Exercise 7.2
1. Write a `for` loop to estimate the 7-day running average of `daily_vaccinations` for `New Jersey`.

## Indefinite loops
- `while` loop

## Exercise 7.3
1. Keep rolling an unbiased dice until you see a 1. How many dice rolls did it take?
2. You have a biased dice where even numbers are 3 times as likely as odd numbers. Keep rolling it until you see a 5. 
3. Stop rolling the above dice till you see a 1 or once you have rolled the dice 10 times, whichever comes first.
