## Homework from Lab-02
1. Create three variables and check if two of the three variables are the same.
2. The molecular weights of amino acids are listed [here](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/rna-tools-and-calculators/proteins-and-amino-acids.html). 
Calculate the molecular weight of this polypeptide - "EKEYLKK"
3. How would you check if the molecular weights of Isoleucine and Leucine are the same? Also check if the molecular weight of Proline is greater than that of Histidine.
4. Create two numeric vectors of length 3 and combine them into a third vector. Create a new vector with ONLY the second elements of first two vectors.
5. What happens when you reference an index greater than the length of a vector? What happens when your index is a negative number?

## Exercise 3.1

1. Find the sum of the first and the last element of a vector.
2. What happens when you add two numeric vectors of the same length?
3. What happens when you add two numeric vectors of the different lengths?

## Subset a vector - recap
- Using indices
- Using names
- Using other vectors
- Using logical variables/vectors

## Sequence function
- What if you have a really large vector of say 100 or even 1000 elements?
- What about a vector of only even numbers between 1 and 100?

## Repeat function
- How would you create a vector of 100 1s?

## Exercise 3.2
1. From the vector of all numbers from 100 to 200, create a new vector with only multiples of 5.
2. Create a vector of all multiples of 10 between 1 and 100 in DECREASING order?
3. What values are in the 3rd and 7th element of the above vector?
4. Create the following vectors

## Matrices

### Creating a matrix

### Accessing elements of a matrix

### Subsetting a matrix into vectors


## Dataframes
- What if you wanted different _types_ of data in each column?

### Creating a data frame

### Accessing and subsetting data frames
- Like a matrix
- Using column names

## Reading external files

### Working with vectors and data frames
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Length gives you number of columns
length()

# Dimensions of a data frame
dim()

# Number of rows of a data frame
nrow()

# Number of columns of a data frame
ncol()

# Identify type of objects
class()

# Structure of a data frame
str()

# Summary functions
min()
max()
mean()
sd()

# Summarize data in all columns
summary()

# Check the type of data in a column
is.logical()
is.numeric()
is.na()
```

## Exercise 3.3
1. Create a new data frame which contains only the first three columns of the old data frame.
2. How many observations have __new_cases__ values in them?
