1. Create three variables and check if two of the three variables are the same.
2. The molecular weights of amino acids are listed [here](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/rna-tools-and-calculators/proteins-and-amino-acids.html). 
Calculate the molecular weight of this polypeptide - "EKEYLKK"
3. How would you check if the molecular weights of Isoleucine and Leucine are the same? Also check if the molecular weight of Proline is greater than that of Histidine.
4. Create two numeric vectors of length 3 and combine them into a third vector. Create a new vector with ONLY the second elements of first two vectors.
5. What happens when you reference an index greater than the length of a vector? What happens when your index is a negative number?
