### Questions

- Over the course of the last few lectures you have used several in-built functions in R. 
- Write your own version of any 5 of these functions. 
- Name the functions as LASTNAME_FUNCTION. For instance, if I were to write a function to calculate sums of values, the function name would be `shah_sum`.
- Important note: You cannot use any in-built functions in writing your function. For instance, if you write a function to calculate `mean` of some values, you cannot use the `sum` function.
