## Description

The main focus of this course is to learn R programming and apply it towards analysis of genomic datasets. In this course, we will focus on basics of programming, data wrangling, creating user-defined functions, and exploratory graphical data analysis. The primary data sets considered will contain genome sequences, genome annotations, RNA-seq and/or other expression data from multiple model organisms.

## Goals
The main objectives of this course are to enable students to learn:

 1. Basics of programming in R programming.
 2. Manipulation of tabular datasets. 
 3. Exploratory data analyses using visualization tools. 
 4. Working with genome sequences and genome annotation files.
 5. Basics of RNA-seq.
 6. Creating pipelines for trimming/mapping of RNA-seq datasets.
 7. Differential gene-expression analysis and identifying gene-ontology and pathway enrichments among gene-sets.
 8. Basics of statistical analyses of genomic datasets.

	### Core Curriculum Learning Goals
	Information Technology and Research [ITR] goals y and z:

	y. Employ current technologies to access information, to conduct research, and to communicate findings.
	z. Analyze and critically assess information from traditional and emergent technologies.

## Pre-requisites
1. **Undergraduates**:
	 - Gen Bio Lab 01:119:117 or 01:119:102  
	 - Genetics 01:447:380 or Genetic Analysis I 01:447:384
	 
2. **Graduate students**:
	While there are no pre-requisites for graduate students to join the class, they are STRONGLY encouraged to participate in the two-day [DataCarpentry workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) that will be conducted during the winter break.

## Website and Communication

### Website
This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shahlab/teaching/tree/master/2019-Fall-CompGen) will serve as the course website.  

### Communication
The primary mode of communication in this course (including major announcements), will be the course Slack account https://ru-compgen-fall19.slack.com. All of you should have invitations to join this account in your Rutgers email.  

### Emails  
Although the bulk of the communication will take place via Slack, at times (rarely), we will send out important course information via email. This email is sent to your Rutgers email address. You are responsible for all information sent out to your University email account, and for checking this account on a regular basis.

## Course Activities

### In-class exercises
Each class will contain 2-4 modules. Each module will involve a ~15 min lecture followed by a programming exercise lasting ~20-30 min. Programming exercises will typically involve 2-5 questions. You will be asked to solve these questions on your own, which will involve applying the functions taught in the lecture part of the module. At the end of the individual exercise portion, I will go over the exercise as a group. Any piece of code written by me will be annotated and commented before being uploaded to the course website.   

### Homeworks
In every lab, you will receive a homework assignment, typically a series of programming exercises that you must code based on the material you learn in class that day. You will upload solutions to these homework as a single R Notebook file before the beginning of the next lab. NO LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ALLOWED. If you miss your due date for the homework, you will receive a 0 points for that assignment.

Each homework is worth 10 points.

### Quizzes
Quizzes will be conducted once every 4 classes. They will last 1-hr and be similar to in-class exercises. Quizzes will typically be "open-book", i.e., you will be able to refer to your class notes, presentations, and my codes. 

Each Quiz is worth 10 points.

### Final Exam
The final exam will be cumulative. Half of the questions will be from previous in-class exercises, homeworks, and quizzes. The other half will involve new applications of the material we cover over the course of the semester. There will be a 15-25 questions. Once you start the Quiz, you will have FOUR hours to complete it. 

### Final projects
Towards the end of the course, all students will be split into teams of 2-3 individuals. Each team will complete a finals research project. Each team can select one of the two broad research topics lsited below:

1. **Comparative genomic analyses**:
	This project will involve downloading genome sequences and annotations of 2 or more organisms and performing various sequence level analyses.
	 
2. **RNA-seq analyses**:
	This project will involve downloading raw sequencing datasets from GEO database and identification of differentially expressed genes and their functional characterization.

Detailed instructions for the finals projects will be given 2 weeks prior to the last class.

### [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education) for Graduate Students
All graduate students taking this course will be assigned one [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education) module every two weeks. The modules will be parallel to the materials covered in the class. The students will be required to submit their certificates of completion from DataCamp. Failure to complete all DataCamp modules will lead to an automatic loss of one grade.

While not required, undergraduates are also encouraged to work through DataCamp modules. No submission of completion certificates is required.

## Grading Information

**Note:** Grades will not be curved. Your grade will be based on your own effort and progress, and not based on competition with your classmates.

**Note for graduate students:** A grade of **D+** or below will automatically be marked as an **F**.

## Academic Integrity
 
We encourage you to interact with other students while doing assignments in class, and in some cases, may be required to work with one another. However, any assignments or homeworks you turn in for grading must represent your own work – it may not be copied from another person’s work. Never use a piece of code unless you know the exactly how it works. If we suspect plagiarism, we will ask you to come in and explain your answers or writing.

The official Rutgers policy on cheating can be found [here](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-at-rutgers/).

There are at least 5 categories of violations: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, denying others access to information or material, and facilitating Violations of Academic Integrity.  Students who violate the Rutgers Integrity policies will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.  Sanctions will be determined by the Office of Student Conduct according to the procedures described in the University Policy on Academic Integrity.
